# This script runs and end-to-end test to ensure that tome
# works for the shell and operating system used.

# fish is wildly different from other shells (it's non-POSIX compliant),
# so a separate testing script is required.

# requirements:
# - ran from the root of the tome repository
# uncomment to get verbose output for debugging
# set -x

# $SHELL doesn't work in this context, albeit preferable,
